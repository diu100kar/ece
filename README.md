## The Need of this Project
In this period of COVID-19 Pandemic, establishments have stopped their normal functioning. 
In such a tragic scenario, the rise of "Online" culture has soared to a phenomenal degree.
This digitisation has also spawned a gigantic lot of data, which is difficult to maintain, and access systematically.\
As a student of an "_Institute of Technology_", I came up with this method, to help my peers, organizing all the links, data, and notices, 
which contrarily would have been troublesome to manage remotely.

## Technologies Used
This project is a basic webpage, no fancy stuff like Database or any backend is used.\
But it does it's work pretty nice, and I think that is what is important.

1. **HTML**:\
  97% of the code here is HTML.\
  This basically tells the site, how to arrange stuff. Simply going through individual files, you'd figure the usage.
  
2. **CSS**:\
  CSS is used for cosmetic control. Programmer defined CSS is used whenever required.
  BOOTSTRAP v4.5.2 is used extensively.
  It includes it's Javascript. 

3. **Supporting Libraries**:\
  a) **JQuery**: Is required for dynamic CSS.\
  b) **PopperJS**: Is required for the 'Pop Over' effect, when selecting the DE courses.

## Analytics
We humans need data. We find patterns wherever we can, even at places where no such pattern exists.\
Google Analytics provides insights to such data. [Here](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report-home/a176052227w243949309p227115805)
